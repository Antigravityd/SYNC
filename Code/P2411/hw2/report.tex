\section{}
The trapezoid rule is the only one that can be used here, since there is no way to calculate $f(\frac{a+b}{2})$.
The program appears in the Script Files section.
Gaussian quadrature is also unuseable here, since we cannot choose evaluation points.

Finding a unique solution for $\alpha, \beta, \gamma$ is a proof of uniqueness of the parabola.
\[f(0)=4.5\Leftrightarrow \alpha(0)^2+\beta(0)+\gamma = 4.5 \Leftrightarrow \gamma = 4.5/\]
\[f(-1)=2\Leftrightarrow 4\alpha+2\beta + 4.5 = 2\Leftrightarrow 4\alpha+2\beta = -2.5\]
\[f(1)=0.9\Leftrightarrow \alpha+\beta + 4.5 = 0.9 \Leftrightarrow \alpha+\beta=-3.6\]
Subtracting twice the third resulting equation from the second yields
\[2\alpha = 4.7 \Leftrigharrow \alpha = 2.35\]
Plugging this in to the second equation,
\[2.35+\beta = -3.6\Leftrightarrow \beta = -5.95\]
