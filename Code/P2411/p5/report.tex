\section{Analytical Solution and Numerical Method}
The solution to the Poisson equation for the gravitational potential with boundary conditions of a uniform charge density sphere of radius $R$ is
\[V(r)=
  \begin{cases}
    \frac{1}{6}(r^2-3R^2), & r \leq R \\
    -\frac{1}{3}\frac{R^3}{r}, & r > R \\
  \end{cases}\]

\section{Library Description}
The inputs to the \verb|rmatrixlu| function are: the matrix to be decomposed, its number of rows, and its number of columns. The dimension of the input matrix is $m\times n$ for arbitrary $m,n\in\mathbf{R}$. The \verb|rmatrixlusolve| function takes an $n\times n$ $LU$-decomposed matrix and a constant $\vec{b}$ vector, outputting the solution vector.
