* Free-form, Serial Key Readout Protocol

The keys of a keyboard (musical or computer) are usually interpreted via keyboard matrices. However, these fix the user into a particular key topology, and cap the number of acceptable keyswitches at design-time. Is there a way to design a fully-flexible, user-configurable keyboard readout protocol?

Yes: an expandable keymatrix.

** Physical Layer

Each key sits on the intersection of  a pair of wires/cables. The keys are, logically speaking, populated at the intersections on a grid of wires. The terminus of these wires is a small, ultra-low-cost microcontroller board which facilitates the dynamic expansion of the keymatrix: the keyboard controller polls the terminus boards over I2C, and they report the digital state of the wire they manage.

Microcontroller possibility: ATTINY202-SSNR
