* My Library

I use this file to manage my personal library as an Org table. This allows me to export it to any format I want for doing data analysis. The fields should be self-explanatory save the "status" field, which indicates my relationship with the text. It ranks 0â€“5 my relationship with the book. 0 means it's on the to-purchase list; 1 means I have it but haven't opened it; 2, that I've skimmed it a little; 3, that I've read it at a surface level (for a math book, maybe I've skipped the theorem proofs and exercises); 4, that I've read it in depth; and 5 means I've read it and understand its concepts totally.

Note: some liberties are taken with LC classifications; for books with a particular edition LC classified, but not the one I actually have, I just borrow that of the other one an update the year. No such liberty was taken in finding Libgen hashes; if the ISBN doesn't match, I leave it blank.

"New" means indistinguishable from new.
"Good" means minor dings and scratches.
"Fair" means primarily external/cosmetic damage: water stains, curled paperback corners, damaged jacket, etc.
"Poor" means internal damage of some kind: margin notes, underlining, dog-earing, external water stains, a missing page or two, and so on.
"Bad" means internal damage that seriously compromises readability. Mostly, over-read paperbacks whose spine is now mush and the pages are falling out.
