Priestly	Cambridge University Press		2		2002	298	New	no	no	Bedroom bookshelf	 978-0-521-7851-1	QA.171.5.D38 2002	875BA80648218E512C5E64867920BBF9	2	Amazon	Fall 2022		Ordered structures have been increasingly recognized in recent yearsdue to an explosion of interest in theoretical computer science and all areas of discrete mathematics.This book covers areas such as ordered sets and lattices.A key feature of ordered sets, one which is emphasized in the text, is that they can be represented pictorially.Lattices are also considered as algebraic structures and hence a purely algebraic studyis used to reinforce the ideas of homomorphisms and of ideals encountered in group theory and ring theory.Exposure to elementary abstract algebra and the rotation of set theory are the only prerequisites for this text.For the new edition, much has been rewritten or expanded and new exercises have been added.
