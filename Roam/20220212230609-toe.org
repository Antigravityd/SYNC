These are just some conjectured axioms that may from the basis for a physical theory.

** Take Planck Quantities Seriously

Measuring distances shorter than the Planck length or time intervals shorter than the Planck time would require particles with such high energy density they would collapse into black holes before a measurement could be made. Therefore, why don't we model spacetime as a discrete, graph-like structure? Considering such graphs embedded in real space, so that there's a classical limit to speak of, an observer would be located at a central node, and there would be edges a Planck length/time going radially outward from the node spaced by the Planck angle; iterate this for the nodes at the end of these edges. All events in the reference frame of the observer would be constrained to lie at the
