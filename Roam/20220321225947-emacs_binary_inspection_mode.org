#+title: Emacs Binary Inspection Mode
* Motivation

Auditing binaries for compiler soundness, security, etc. is hard. Emacs is cool. Make them kiss?

* Implementation

- Use some tool to raise the binary to assembly or LLVM IR with excellent support for "folding" sections to hex and back
- If the source is in hand then enable source-binary correlation via highlight and cursor sync
- Decompilation?
- Sensible navigation of object file, with options to display execution path, etc.
