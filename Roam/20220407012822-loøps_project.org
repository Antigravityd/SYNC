* Motivation

Searching "loop quantum gravity computation" on Web of Science yields zero results. This can't be because it's impossible; the first computational topology conference was when the subject was done in ALGOL, and differential geometry is just a fancy way of writing down PDEs, so there's no reason computational tools couldn't be developed.

* Similar Work

?

* Feasibility

I've got enough of the math to make it somewhat possible. I'd be reading a lot of reviews though.

* Implementation

I'll need to talk to Agullo or one of the other LQG people about it, get their approval & reading recommendations, and have them loosely supervise progress. This would be ideal to supplement work with Chancellor over the summer.
